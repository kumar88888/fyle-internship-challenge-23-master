# Angular Project Setup and Testing

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up an Angular project and running tests using the Angular CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): It comes with Node.js installation.

## Install Angular CLI

The Angular CLI is a command-line interface for Angular development. Install it globally on your machine using the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests
